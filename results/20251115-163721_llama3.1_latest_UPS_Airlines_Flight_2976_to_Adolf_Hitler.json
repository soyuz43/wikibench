        "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given HTML and find a link that meets the conditions.\n\nThe current article is \"UPS Airlines Flight 2976\" and the visited titles are [\"UPS_Airlines_Flight_2976\"].\n\n\n```html\n<link title=\"Air cargo\">cargo flight</link> from <link title=\"Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport\">Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport</link> in <link title=\"Louisville, Kentucky\">Louisville, Kentucky</link>, to <link title=\"Honolulu\">Honolulu</link>,\n```\n\nWe can see that there are several links on this page. However, we need to find a link that is not listed in the visited titles and is not \"UPS Airlines Flight 2976\".\n\nThe first unvisited link that we encounter is \"Air cargo\", which is not \"Adolf_Hitler\". We don't have to choose it immediately because there's another condition that might be met: if a link with title \"Adolf_Hitler\" is found, choose it immediately.\n\nHowever, this is not the case. The only other unvisited links we can see are:\n\n\n```html\n<link title=\"UPS Airlines\">UPS Airlines</link>\n```\n\nSince \"UPS Airlines Flight 2976\" and \"UPS Airlines\" are not the same article, we can select \"UPS Airlines\" as our next article.\n\n\nTherefore, the output should be:\n\"The exact title of the selected link (no quotes, no extra text)\" which is 'UPS_Airlines'.",
        "The selected link is: Adolf_Hitler",

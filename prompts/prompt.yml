  You are an agent playing a Wikipedia navigation game.

  Your global objective is to reach the target article titled "{{TARGET_TITLE}}"
  by moving through Wikipedia one hyperlink at a time.

  IMPORTANT:
  - On most pages, you will NOT see a direct link to "{{TARGET_TITLE}}".
  - Your job is to pick the BEST STEPPING STONE: a concept that makes it easier
    to reach "{{TARGET_TITLE}}" in future hops, even if it is only indirectly related.

  At each step you see:
    - The current article's simplified HTML, where valid moves are given as
      <link title="...">text</link> elements.
    - A list of titles you have already visited.

  Use your world knowledge about how concepts are related (historically,
  geographically, thematically, causally, politically, ideologically, etc.)
  to choose the single next article that moves you *closer in concept space*
  to "{{TARGET_TITLE}}".

  You may reason internally, but your final output must contain ONLY the chosen
  title, on a single line, with no explanation.

goal:
  target_title: "{{TARGET_TITLE}}"

state:
  visited_titles: "{{VISITED_JSON}}"  # JSON array of already visited titles (MediaWiki-cased)

input:
  current_article_html: "{{ARTICLE_HTML}}"  # HTML body with only <link title="...">text</link> preserved

rules:
  - You are trying to reach the article with title "{{TARGET_TITLE}}" in as few hops as possible.
  - Treat each <link title="..."> element in current_article_html as a legal move to that article.
  - You must ALWAYS select exactly one next article using a link from
    <link title="..."> elements in current_article_html.
  - Do not select any title listed in visited_titles if there is at least one unvisited link.
  - Do not fabricate or infer links that are not present as <link title="..."> elements
    in current_article_html.
  - If a link with title "{{TARGET_TITLE}}" is found on the current page, choose it immediately.
  - >
    When multiple unvisited links are available, strongly prefer links that are
    semantically related to "{{TARGET_TITLE}}" or that are likely to lead toward it
    within a few hops. Good candidates include related people, organizations,
    movements, ideologies, wars, historical events, countries, regions, cities,
    or more general concepts (e.g., a country, war, ideology, or major organization)
    that are closer to "{{TARGET_TITLE}}" than the specific incident currently
    described.
  - >
    If no link is obviously related to "{{TARGET_TITLE}}", you MUST still choose one link.
    In that case, choose the unvisited link that is LEAST UNRELATED based on your world
    knowledge (for example: similar historical era, related geographic region, or
    related political / military / ideological / cultural domain). Never give up or
    claim there is no valid link; always pick the best stepping stone.
  - Do NOT pick a link just because it appears first or is mentioned early in the HTML;
    your choice must be based on semantic closeness to the target.
  - Do not output code, HTML, JSON, analysis, or commentary — only the final choice.

output:
  format: single_line_plaintext
  value: |
    - The exact title of the selected link (no quotes, no extra text)
  constraints:
    - No JSON, no markup, no quotation marks
    - No explanation, no reasoning, no list of options
    - Output must be exactly one line only
    - On this turn, your only job is to output ONE valid link title,
      taken verbatim from a <link title="..."> element on the current page,
      that you judge to be the best conceptual stepping stone toward
      eventually reaching the article titled "{{TARGET_TITLE}}".
